Bee Movie is the first motion-picture script written by Seinfeld, who co-wrote the film with Spike Feresten, Barry Marder, and Andy Robin. The film was produced by Seinfeld, Christina Steinberg, and Cameron Stevning. The production was designed by Alex McDowell, and Christophe Lautrette was the art director.

The cast and crew include some veterans of the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld, including writer/producers Feresten and Robin, and actors Warburton, Michael Richards, and Larry Miller.

Bee Movie was theatrically released on November 2, 2007 to mixed reviews, receiving praise for its humor and voice cast but criticism for its premise and plot. The film was a moderate box office success, grossing $293 million worldwide against a $150 million budget.
