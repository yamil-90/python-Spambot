# Python Spambot

this python program was made for fun and to test the pyautogui package.

to use it simply add the desired text into the message.txt run the program and then (quickly!) click the text box where you want the program to start writing (for example the message box in whatsapp web)
after 10 seconds the program will proceed to write word by word (pressing enter in the middle for extra lines) the message you added into message.txt
you can load really long texts to bother your friends but beware that some of them blocked me after that.... :(

### TL;DR

how to use
--
* load the message in message.txt
* open the messaging program of choice
* run spambot.py (you have 10 seconds before the program starts spamming)
* click the message box of the victim
* watch in horror as the program writes word by word by pressing enter between them
* to stop the program go to the terminal and press ctr+c
